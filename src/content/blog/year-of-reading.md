My 2023 new years resolution is to read 26 (52 weeks in a year and assuming I can spend half of my year reading) books this year. I'm making this a public goal in order to keep myself accountable for it. I don't know exactly how this post is going to evolve throught the year but my hope is that this is a live page where I start off with a list of the books I'm reading and maybe eventually start adding in different stats to quanitify my learning.
