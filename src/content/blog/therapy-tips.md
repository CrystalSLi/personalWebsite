I went through a really tough time this year. TLDR; My dad lost all of his (and my) savings due to a pig butchering scam. I went through the worst heartbreak I've ever had to deal with with my first queer love. Spent two weeks isolated from all the people I love due to stupid Covid. And I moved to a new city 2000 miles away from home. 
After talking to some close friends and realizing it wasn't normal to not be able to sleep until 4am. I spent a bit of time finding a therapist. Here are some things that I learned that helped me. 
1. Use Psychology Today. 
    - I've lived with two therapists. And both of them, when I asked how I should start trying to find a therapist. The first thing they said was "Use Psychology Today"
2. Yes, it will be hard to find a therapist. But that doesn't mean you should settle for the first one that calls you back. I would recommend finding a therapist with a similar background to you. You want somebody that can empathize with you. 
    - One thing T (my therapist) said that stuck with me was during our call was, "Normally, if you were white. I would maybe start talking about setting up boundaries. But knowing that you grew up in an asian household. I know that's not what you should be doing right now." This helped me come out to my dad last year about my sexuality. 
3. There should be an initial 15 minute consultation so that your therapist can decide if they want to take you on. But more importantly, for you to figure out if this somebody you would be comfortable sharing your most intimate thoughts with.
    - It's going to be a numbers game. Call as many therapists as you can. Not all will respond. And not all will be a good match for you. 
4. Share your most intrusive, darkest, deepest thoughts with them. Trust me, as bad as you may think they are. They never are. 
    - And if your therapist makes you feel bad about yourself then they are not the right therapist for you.  
5. Your therapist should not spend the majority of the time talking.
    - You are paying them to listen. Not to talk. 
6. You can use your HSA and FSA to pay for therapy. 
7. Alot of really good therapists are out of net work, it makes sense for them because if they were to take insurance they would make around 50k a year vs being out of network they can earn up to 200k a year. 
8. If you want a really amazing therapist but cannot afford the high price tag look at Pelican Cove Therapy center or similar centers that are placees where they train therapists. 
9. Your therapist has to be in the same state as you. 
    - It's a stupid law justified by by a dumb reasoning (if you were to want to harm yourself they don't think therapists would know the right in state number to call). 
10. There's no such thing as a perfect patient. Don't try to be one. Just bring your most authentic self. And be okay with sharing.
